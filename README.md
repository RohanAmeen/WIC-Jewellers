WIC Jewellers Web Page

This project is a responsive web page for WIC Jewellers, developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The site features four main sections: Home, About, Shop, and Contact, each with well-structured content. The page includes consistent headers and footers to enhance navigation and user experience.

Bootstrap was utilized to create a mobile-friendly and visually appealing design, with a clean and modern layout for smooth navigation between sections.
